# Web UI for RetroNAS

Written as a Cockpit package, this web ui can be extended to mimic the functionality of the RetroNAS TUI which is currently all we are aiming for.

The [Cockpit project](https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/cockpit-file "Cockpit project") is a web based Systems Administration tool and as such should not be presented to the public internet  unless you want your box and network  hosed.

This is an EXPERIMENTAL frontend, use at your own risk.
